# HIP-106: Superbase — Unified Hanzo Cloud Binary

## Abstract

This proposal defines `superbase` — a single Go binary that imports every
Hanzo-native subsystem as a package and dispatches requests to them by
HTTP path, subsystem flag, or per-deployment configuration. The same
binary powers `api.hanzo.ai`, `api.osage.cloud`, `api.lux.cloud`,
`api.zoo.cloud`, and every other white-label resold cloud surface.
Brand, enabled subsystems, and tenant scope are deployment
configuration; the binary is the same artifact across all.

**Naming note**: `superbase` is the unified binary. `~/work/hanzo/cloud`
is and remains the **LLM control plane** subsystem per HIP-0037 — it is
one of the subsystems mounted into `superbase`, not the binary itself.

**Inter-subsystem contract**: ZAP (the Hanzo native binary protocol).
Every subsystem ships its public interface as a `.zap` schema; `zapc`
generates Go/TS/Python/Rust bindings; `superbase` wires the in-process
ZAP-typed Go interfaces when subsystems are co-resident, falls back to
ZAP RPC over the wire when split. **No `.capnp` files anywhere in
Hanzo-authored code.**

The substrate this HIP depends on landed in HIP-0105 (in-process
extension runtime). HIP-0106 is what you build *on top of* HIP-0105 to
fold the existing Hanzo Go services into a single multi-tenant
supervised process.

## Motivation

Today Hanzo ships ~11+ Go-native services as independent binaries: IAM,
Base, KMS, Gateway, Ingress, Commerce, Cloud (LLM control plane), o11y,
AMQP, MCP (Go path), DNS, VFS, MQ, Authz, Agents. Each gets its own
Dockerfile, Helm chart, deploy lane, CI workflow, release cadence, and
observability spine. For Hanzo this is acceptable — we operate the
cluster. For **white-label resell** (`lux.cloud`, `zoo.cloud`,
`osage.cloud`, and others) it's not: every customer needs the same
constellation of services, isolated per-tenant, billed per-tenant,
auth'd against unified IAM. Shipping 11+ binaries × N customers × 3
environments multiplies operational surface beyond what a small team
should run.

The audit at `~/work/hanzo/AUDIT_2026_05_19.md` confirms ~35 Go-native
services structurally ready for inclusion, of which **3 already export
`func Mount(r, deps)`** — `commerce`, `gateway`, and `vfs`. These are
the reference implementations.

The unified binary collapses this:

1. **One artifact**, `ghcr.io/hanzoai/superbase:vX.Y.Z`, that contains
   every Hanzo Go subsystem as compiled code.
2. **Deployment configuration** at startup enables a subset of subsystems
   (`superbase --enable=iam,base,kms,commerce,gateway,cloud`).
3. **Per-tenant routing** at request time: `X-Org-Id` from JWT picks
   the tenant's Base instance, KMS namespace, IAM application, and brand.
4. **Multi-tenant Base** at the storage layer per HIP-0302: each tenant
   org gets its own per-tenant data file (`data/{orgSlug}.db` for the
   SQLite backend, equivalent path for the ZapDB backend) with a
   per-org HKDF-derived DEK from a master key in KMS. **Replicate
   works for both backends** — SQLite WAL streaming and ZapDB-native
   log shipping use the same age-encrypted GCS bucket sink. Already
   the pattern in `~/work/hanzo/iam` and `~/work/hanzo/base`; this HIP
   makes it the universal contract.
5. **Unified IAM auth** at the boundary per HIP-0026: every subsystem
   trusts JWTs from one shared `iam.hanzo.id` JWKS endpoint. Gateway
   strips client-supplied identity headers, mints validated ones from
   the JWT, forwards in-process.
6. **ZAP-typed interfaces** between subsystems. Same generated Go code
   serves both in-process direct calls and over-wire RPC. Bootnode and
   other subsystems already use this pattern via `pycapnp`/`zapc-rs`
   today.

## Specification

### Canonical Hanzo Go stack

The unified binary is opinionated. Every subsystem uses the same Go
substrate. **One way to do everything.** No parallel frameworks, no
parallel ORMs, no parallel loggers, no parallel wire formats.

| Concern | Canonical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web framework | `hanzoai/zip` | The ONE Go web framework. Built on Fiber v3 / fasthttp (implementation detail). Sinatra/Express-style primary API. **No `.Fast` escape hatch — zip is fast.** |
| ORM | `hanzoai/orm` | Backends: SQLite (today), PostgreSQL/MySQL/MSSQL/Oracle via `dbx` (wiring pending), ZapDB via `luxfi/database`, CR-SQLite for client-side distributed (license-permitting). |
| Logger | `luxfi/log` | NEVER `uber-go/zap`, NEVER `log/slog`, NEVER stdlib `log`. |
| Wire protocol | ZAP | Every subsystem ships `<svc>/schema/<name>.zap`. `zapc` generates Go/TS/Py/Rust bindings. No `.capnp` files in Hanzo-authored source. |
| Storage durability | `hanzoai/replicate` over `hanzo/vfs` | Per HIP-0107 (streaming replication over vfs). Covers SQLite WAL, ZapDB log, blockchain state, generic logs through one pipeline. |
| Object store interface | `hanzo/vfs` | The ONLY object-store interface. All sink-side bytes route through vfs. |
| Analytical store | `hanzoai/datastore-go` | Separate from `orm`. NOT an ORM backend — different workload class. |

**Migration adapters (transitional only, not parallel ways to build new
services):** `zip.Adapt(http.Handler)`, `zip.AdaptChi(chi.Router)`,
`zip.MountBeego(beego.App)`, `zip.MountGin(gin.Engine)`. These exist so
existing chi/beego/gin code can be wrapped into a zip mount without a
same-day rewrite. New code must be written natively against zip.

### Process model

`superbase` is a single process exposing:

- One HTTP listener (default `:8080`) that fans out to subsystem
  handlers by URL prefix (`/v1/iam/...`, `/v1/base/...`, etc.)
- One ZAP RPC listener (default `:9653`) for service-to-service auth
  and inter-subsystem calls when split across binaries
- One health/metrics endpoint at `:9090`
- One admin endpoint at `:8081` (gated by IAM admin role)

Subsystem activation:

```bash
superbase \
  --enable=iam,base,kms,commerce,gateway,cloud,o11y \
  --brand=osage \
  --domain=osage.cloud \
  --iam-issuer=https://iam.hanzo.id \
  --kms-master-key-ref=kms://hanzo/superbase/osage/master \
  --data-dir=/var/lib/superbase
```

Each subsystem flag enables that subsystem's HTTP routes, ZAP services,
and background workers. Disabled subsystems contribute zero runtime
cost beyond the compiled code in the binary.

### Subsystem boundaries

Each Hanzo Go service exposes a single
`Mount(app *zip.App, deps superbase.Deps) error` function (canonical
signature; the old `chi.Router`-based shape is migrated through the
`zip.AdaptChi` adapter). `superbase`'s `main.go` is essentially:

```go
import (
    "github.com/hanzoai/zip"
    "github.com/hanzoai/iam"
    "github.com/hanzoai/base"
    "github.com/hanzoai/kms"
    "github.com/hanzoai/commerce"
    "github.com/hanzoai/cloud"      // LLM control plane subsystem
    "github.com/hanzoai/gateway"
    "github.com/hanzoai/o11y"
    "github.com/hanzoai/vfs"
    "github.com/hanzoai/mq"
    "github.com/hanzoai/dns"
    "github.com/hanzoai/amqp"
    "github.com/hanzoai/mcp"
    "github.com/hanzoai/superbase"
)

func main() {
    cfg := superbase.LoadConfig()
    deps := superbase.BuildDeps(cfg)
    app := zip.New()

    if cfg.Enabled("iam")      { iam.Mount(app, deps)      }
    if cfg.Enabled("kms")      { kms.Mount(app, deps)      }
    if cfg.Enabled("base")     { base.Mount(app, deps)     }
    if cfg.Enabled("commerce") { commerce.Mount(app, deps) }
    if cfg.Enabled("cloud")    { cloud.Mount(app, deps)    }
    if cfg.Enabled("gateway")  { gateway.Mount(app, deps)  }
    if cfg.Enabled("o11y")     { o11y.Mount(app, deps)     }
    if cfg.Enabled("vfs")      { vfs.Mount(app, deps)      }
    if cfg.Enabled("mq")       { mq.Mount(app, deps)       }
    if cfg.Enabled("dns")      { dns.Mount(app, deps)      }
    if cfg.Enabled("amqp")     { amqp.Mount(app, deps)     }
    if cfg.Enabled("mcp")      { mcp.Mount(app, deps)      }
    // ...

    superbase.Serve(app, cfg)  // HTTP + ZAP RPC + admin
}
```

This means **every existing Go service must expose a `Mount` function**
in addition to its `cmd/<service>/main.go`. The `main.go` becomes a
thin shim that calls `Mount` on its own; `superbase`'s main calls the
same `Mount` from its own binary. No business logic moves.

Reference implementations already in tree (per `AUDIT_2026_05_19.md`):
**`commerce`, `gateway`, `vfs`** — these export `Mount(...)` today. New
subsystems join by mirroring their shape.

### ZAP schema contract

Every subsystem ships a public `.zap` schema describing its in-process
and over-wire interface. Build pipeline:

```
<subsystem>/
  schema/<name>.zap       # public typed interface
  zap/gen/                # zapc-generated bindings (Go for our use, others optional)
    <name>.go             # generated structs + interfaces
    <name>_server.go      # server-side handlers
    <name>_client.go      # typed client (in-process or RPC)
  Makefile / build.sh     # `zapc generate <schema>.zap --lang go --out ./zap/gen/`
```

`zapc` is the Rust-implemented Hanzo ZAP compiler at `~/work/hanzo/zap/zapc-rs/`.
Multi-language codegen: `zapc generate file.zap --lang {go,ts,py,rust}`.

When `superbase` runs subsystems in-process: each `Mount(...)` registers
its `*_server.go` against the local ZAP dispatcher, and the typed
client interfaces in `deps` resolve to **direct Go function calls
through the ZAP runtime** (no marshalling, no network). When subsystems
are split: same generated client makes ZAP RPC calls over the
wire. Same business code in either mode.

**Existing `.zap` schemas in production** (real, not aspirational):
- `~/work/hanzo/cloud/cloud.zap` — LLM control plane types (ChatMessage, ModelProvider, ChatCompletion)
- `~/work/hanzo/commerce/api/billing/billing.zap` — billing schemas
- `~/work/hanzo/tasks/schema/tasks.zap` — task scheduling
- `~/work/hanzo/zap/rust/schema/zap.zap` — self-describing schema

Subsystems with generated bindings under `<svc>/zap/`:
`python-sdk/proto/zap`, `kv/modules/zap`, `playground/internal/zap`,
`hanzo.ai/components/zap`, `platform/pkg/zap`, `mcp/dist/zap`,
`dev/hanzo-dev/zap`, `docdb/internal/zap`, `vector/src/zap`. At least
10+ subsystems already on the pattern.

**Policy**: no `.capnp` files. No "Cap'n Proto" identifiers in
Hanzo-authored source. ZAP is Hanzo-native and is the only thing the
public surface knows about. (Brand-policy parity with @hanzo/gui / Zen
MoDE — see CLAUDE.md.)

### Tenant isolation

| Layer | Today | Under HIP-106 |
|---|---|---|
| **Auth** | Per-domain IAM (multi-tenant) | Unchanged. IAM resolves `(app, org)` from origin; subsystems see JWT claims via `X-Org-Id`. |
| **Storage** | Per-service postgres or per-tenant SQLite (varies) | Always per-tenant SQLite (`{data-dir}/orgs/{org}/{service}.db`) with per-org DEK per HIP-0302. No postgres in the unified path. |
| **KMS** | Per-org master keys today | Unchanged. KMS in-process serves `kms://<deployment>/<org>/<purpose>` references. |
| **Cache** | Per-service Redis (varies) | Process-local LRU or per-org sub-buckets in shared in-memory cache. No Redis. |
| **Brand** | Per-domain detection in app code | `cfg.Brand` at startup; subsystems read brand from deps; UI templates resolved from embedded assets. |

### Subsystem-to-subsystem calls

In the unified binary, IAM, KMS, Base, Commerce, Cloud, etc. live in
the **same process address space**. Inter-subsystem calls are
**ZAP-typed Go function calls** via the deps:

```go
type Deps struct {
    IAM        iamzap.Client       // generated from iam/schema/iam.zap
    KMS        kmszap.Client       // generated from kms/schema/kms.zap
    Base       basezap.Client      // generated from base/schema/base.zap
    Commerce   commercezap.Client  // generated from commerce/schema/commerce.zap
    Cloud      cloudzap.Client     // generated from cloud/schema/cloud.zap
    O11y       o11yzap.Client      // generated from o11y/schema/o11y.zap
    BrandCfg   brand.Config
}
```

Each generated `Client` has two implementations:

- **in-process** (direct method calls through the local ZAP dispatcher)
- **RPC** (ZAP-typed RPC over the wire)

`superbase` wires in-process. Legacy split deploys wire RPC. Same
business code in either mode. **Every subsystem boundary is typed end
to end** via the `.zap` schema.

### Extension surface

User-supplied code inside the unified binary uses the in-process
extension runtime from HIP-0105:

- Per-record hooks in Base → **goja** (per HIP-0105 scale findings:
  goja wins multi-tenant SaaS at scale)
- Per-request policy rules in Gateway → **wazero** (untrusted) or
  **native** (Hanzo-authored)
- Custom prompt transforms for Cloud (LLM control plane) → **wazero**
- Custom tool functions for Agents → **wazero**

The extension runtime IS the user-code boundary inside the unified
process. Don't shell out, don't spawn sidecars, don't run Knative pods
for per-request hooks. HIP-0060 (Functions) handles the workloads where
those overheads are justified.

### Multi-language handlers

HIP-0105 defines two mount points (in-process Base hooks AND web routes
via `hanzoai/zip`). The unified binary uses **mount point #2** to allow
service routes themselves to be authored in any HIP-0105-supported
language:

| Language | Runtime | Mount path |
|---|---|---|
| Go (Hanzo-authored) | native | direct in-process — default for all service code |
| Rust / C++ / Zig / AssemblyScript | wazero | compiled to `*.wasm`, loaded under `hz_routes/<name>/` |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | goja (production) or v8go (experimental) | source files loaded directly |
| Python | pyvm (single-tenant only, `-tags pyvm`) | CPython 3.13 sub-interpreter pool |
| DSL / policy | starlark | sandboxed, deterministic, no I/O by default |

All five runtimes mount through the SAME `zip.App` via
`app.Module(method+path, runtime, modulePath)`. The route author writes
their handler in their preferred language; the same `.zap` schemas
generate the same I/O types across all of them. Crash isolation,
cancellation semantics, and scale characteristics are exactly as
described in HIP-0105.

Multi-tenant deployments MUST gate `AllowedRuntimes` to exclude runtimes
lacking hard sandbox (pyvm, v8go).

### Deployment surfaces this enables

| Deployment | Brand | Enabled subsystems | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hanzo flagship | hanzo | all | api.hanzo.ai |
| Osage Cloud | osage | iam, base, kms, commerce, cloud, gateway, o11y, vfs | api.osage.cloud |
| Lux Cloud | lux | iam, base, kms, gateway, chain | api.lux.cloud |
| Zoo Cloud | zoo | iam, base, kms, brain, gateway, vfs | api.zoo.cloud |
| Customer X (reseller) | custom | iam, base, kms, commerce, gateway | api.x.com |

Same image. Different startup configuration. The `osage.cloud`
marketing site that shipped 2026-05-19 gets a real backend when this
HIP lands.

## Migration plan

Multi-week real engineering. Order revised from `AUDIT_2026_05_19.md`
findings:

### Phase 1 — Mount contract on reference + smallest services (1 week)

The audit identified three subsystems that **already export `Mount(...)`**:
**`commerce`, `gateway`, `vfs`**. These are the reference impl shape.
Mount contract is then extracted from the smallest remaining services:

1. **commerce** (reference) — production, multi-tenant (37 X-Org-Id
   call-sites), IAM-integrated, `Mount` exists. Validate the
   pattern; harden Deps interface.
2. **gateway** (reference) — `Mount` exists. Validate that the
   subsystem can be both standalone and embedded.
3. **vfs** (reference) — `Mount` exists. Smallest of the three.
4. **kms** — smallest service still needing `Mount`; clean deps
5. **dns** — small, no auth dep
6. **amqp** — small, no auth dep
7. **authz** — first to consume `deps.IAM`

### Phase 2 — Ship `superbase` (1 week)

`~/work/hanzo/superbase/cmd/superbase/main.go` — new repo
`github.com/hanzoai/superbase`. Imports the seven subsystems from
Phase 1, wires Deps, dispatches by subsystem flag. Ship as
`ghcr.io/hanzoai/superbase:v0.1.0`. Single-tenant smoke deployment at
a dev domain first.

### Phase 3 — Fold the heavy subsystems (2 weeks)

8. **iam** — has its own SPA; mount handlers without changing SPA
9. **base** — `plugins/extruntime`, `plugins/jsvm`, `plugins/wasmvm`
   must remain isolated per-org (per HIP-0105)
10. **o11y** — heaviest multi-tenant footprint (309 X-Org-Id call-sites
    per audit). Get this right and the per-tenant routing pattern is
    proven for everything else.
11. **cloud** (LLM control plane per HIP-0037) — mount existing routes
12. **mcp** — depends on iam
13. **mq** — depends on base for durability
14. **ingress** — depends on gateway routes

### Phase 4 — Tenant routing layer (1 week)

Universal `X-Org-Id` gating at the unified mux entry. Per-tenant data
isolation enforced by Base. KMS reference resolution scoped to the
calling org. Telemetry tagged with org.

### Phase 5 — Reseller provisioning (1 week)

Operator CRD `ResellerCloud{name, parentOrg, brand, enabledSubsystems}`
that creates the IAM app + KMS namespace + Base storage allocation +
Gateway routes atomically. Documented at
`~/work/hanzo/superbase/docs/RESELLER.md`. Self-serve resell becomes
possible.

Resolves the audit's "three competing operator lineages" finding by
picking one and converging on it.

### Phase 6 — Billing wiring (separate HIP follow-up)

Commerce subsystem reads per-tenant usage from base + o11y/ClickHouse
and applies the reseller revenue-share contract. Per the audit,
**`commerce` is the canonical billing/pricing/subscription home** —
the TS `billing`, `pricing`, and `auto` packages get absorbed into
`commerce` via Go rewrites.

## Non-goals

- **TS service rewrite as part of this HIP.** Platform (Next.js /
  Dokploy fork), brain (where still TS), bot, billing/pricing/auto
  (separate Go rewrites slated under commerce subsumption). They can
  be ported to Go later if performance or operations require it; this
  HIP does not block on them.
- **Folding Python services.** LangFlow (`~/work/hanzo/flow`),
  inference servers, ML pipelines remain separate. They communicate
  with the unified binary via HTTP behind the gateway subsystem.
- **`vault` is explicitly NOT folded.** Vault is PCI-compliant CDE
  (card data environment) per the audit. Folding it into a
  multi-tenant binary would expand PCI scope to every other tenant in
  the process. Vault stays a separate process with its own deployment.
  **Hard rule, no exceptions.**
- **Cross-deployment service mesh.** The unified binary collapses
  in-deployment service calls; cross-deployment (Hanzo ↔ Lux ↔ Zoo)
  stays on the existing service-discovery + bridge layer.
- **Auto-scaling per-subsystem.** All subsystems in one binary scale
  together. If a subsystem becomes a hot bottleneck, fall back to
  running it as its own binary alongside the unified one — the Mount
  contract supports both.

## Open questions

1. **Cold start under load** — single binary with all subsystems boots
   slower than a focused service. Acceptable for long-lived
   deployments; needs measurement for fast-restart scenarios. Suggest
   benchmarking on Phase 2.

2. **Per-subsystem memory budgets** — one OOM kills every subsystem.
   Acceptable trade-off for resell where blast radius is per-customer
   anyway, but Hanzo flagship may want to keep some subsystems split.

3. **Routes that conflict** — `/v1/iam/...`, `/v1/base/...`,
   `/v1/commerce/...`, etc. Already mostly per-subsystem-prefixed.
   The unified mux compiles a route table at startup and refuses to
   start on collision.

4. **Build-time flags vs runtime flags** — for production we want
   every subsystem compiled in. For developer builds we might want to
   disable some at build time to shrink the binary. Suggest both: Go
   build tags for compile-time, CLI flags for runtime.

5. **ZAP versioning** — when a subsystem evolves its `.zap` schema,
   how do we manage cross-version compat? Suggest semver on the
   `.zap` file itself (`@version 1.2.0` directive) and `zapc`
   refusing breaking changes without an explicit major bump. Tracked
   for follow-up.

6. **Three competing operator lineages** — `operator/`,
   `hanzo-operator/`, `operator-core/` (Rust). Audit flagged for
   convergence. Phase 5 (reseller provisioning) is blocked on
   picking one. Suggest dedicated session for the operator decision
   before Phase 5 starts.
